# Fallout Community Edition

Fallout Community Edition is a re-implementation of Fallout with the original gameplay, engine bugfixes, and a few quality-of-life improvements. This repository supports Linux only.

There is also [Fallout 2 Community Edition](https://github.com/alexbatalov/fallout2-ce).

## Installation

You must own the game to play. Purchase your copy on [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/fallout) or [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/38400), then download the latest [release](https://github.com/alexbatalov/fallout1-ce/releases) or build from source.

Linux only:

- Prepare a `Fallout` directory with the original game data: `master.dat`, `critter.dat`, and `data/`.
- If needed, extract the files from the GOG installer:

```console
$ sudo apt install innoextract
$ innoextract ~/Downloads/setup_fallout_2.1.0.18.exe -I app
$ mv app Fallout
```

- To build from source on Linux, install the SDL3 development package and the current build dependencies:

```console
$ sudo apt install cmake g++ libsdl3-dev zlib1g-dev
$ cmake -B build -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
$ cmake --build build -j $(nproc)
```

- If you downloaded a release, copy `fallout-ce` into that directory.
- If you built from source, copy `build/fallout-ce` into that directory.
- Run `./fallout-ce`.

## Configuration

The main configuration file is `fallout.cfg`. There are several important settings you might need to adjust for your installation. Depending on your Fallout distribution main game assets `master.dat`, `critter.dat`, and `data` folder might be either all lowercased, or all uppercased. You can either update `master_dat`, `critter_dat`, `master_patches` and `critter_patches` settings to match your file names, or rename files to match entries in your `fallout.cfg`.

The `sound` folder (with `music` folder inside) might be located either in `data` folder, or be in the Fallout folder. Update `music_path1` setting to match your hierarchy, usually it's `data/sound/music/` or `sound/music/`. Make sure it match your path exactly (so it might be `SOUND/MUSIC/` if you've installed Fallout from CD). Music files themselves (with `ACM` extension) should be all uppercased, regardless of `sound` and `music` folders.

The second configuration file is `f1_res.ini`. Use it to change game window size and enable/disable fullscreen mode.

```ini
[MAIN]
SCR_WIDTH=1280
SCR_HEIGHT=720
WINDOWED=1
```

Recommendation:
- **Linux desktop**: Use any size you see fit.

In time this stuff will receive in-game interface, right now you have to do it manually.

## Contributing

Here is a couple of current goals. Open up an issue if you have suggestion or feature request.

- **Update to v1.2**. This project is based on Reference Edition which implements v1.1 released in November 1997. There is a newer v1.2 released in March 1998 which at least contains important multilingual support.

- **Backport some Fallout 2 features**. Fallout 2 (with some Sfall additions) added many great improvements and quality of life enhancements to the original Fallout engine. Many deserve to be backported to Fallout 1. Keep in mind this is a different game, with slightly different gameplay balance (which is a fragile thing on its own).
